\section{Conclusion}
The performed numerical simulations and experiments with bacon preparation
in a microwave oven gave satisfactory results so far as they were implemented. 
The numerical simulations of the heat equations gave reasonable results in agreement
with experiments. An implementation of the transport equation would have been
more satisfactory, and is suggested as a possibility for future work in this
direction. The experiments performed suggest that the fat transport is
complicated, and that gravity is not dominating the flow.
