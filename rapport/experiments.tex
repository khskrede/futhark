\section{Execution}

The baocn slice was laid between one sheet of paper on top, and one sheet of
grease-proof paper beneath. Earlier experiments with dual layer paper had
resulted in fusing of the bacon and paper. Still we needed to absorb the fat
output, so a compromise was to combine paper (for fat absorption) and
grease-proof paper (preventing fat spillage). $\\$

First we measured the weight of the wrapping (paper and grease-proof paper), and
then we measured the dimensions of the bacon; weight, length, thickness and
width. The bacon slice was wrapped and baked in the microwave oven for the
desired amount of time. After completion we measured new dimensions, both of
bacon and wrapping and assigned a number between 0.0-1.0 describing how crisp
the bacon had gotten.

\section{Measurements}

First we measured weight gain in the wrapping, then weight loss in the bacon. We
assumed that all gain in the wrapping came from fat absorption, and that the
weight loss in the bacon consisted of fat melting and water evaporation. The new
dimensions of the bacon were also documented. $\\$

The assumptions combined with our measurements made it possible to quantify fat
loss, water loss and shrinkage of the bacon. This gave us the plots in
\cref{fig:thick_bacon} and \cref{fig:regular_bacon}.

\section{Results and discussion}

As we can see in \cref{fig:thick_bacon} the water loss from 30-35 seconds is
approximately constant, the fat loss on the other hand is increasing on the same
time interval. This shows that around 30-35 seconds fat starts to melt,
``stealing'' heat from the water, this is in correspondence with weight loss as
a function of time. The fat loss continues to be linearly
increasing up to about 50 seconds, see \cref{fig:regular_bacon}. After 50
seconds the fat loss stabilizes, indicating that no more fat can be lost, and
that further baking time results in burnt bacon. $\\$

These results coincides with our anticipations, that the weight loss would
stabilize after a critical time. Something that is clearly demonstrated in
\cref{fig:baconplot}. It is worth commenting that the big variation in
\cref{fig:regular_bacon} for $t = 50$s is due to one enormous (relative to the
others) bacon slice.
